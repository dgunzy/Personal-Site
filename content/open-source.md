# Open Source Contributions

I'm passionate about contributing back to the open source community that has provided so many amazing tools and technologies. Here are some of the projects I've had the privilege to begin to contribute to (in the smallest way so far üòÅ):

## Docker

Docker has revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications.

**Project Link:** [Docker on GitHub](https://github.com/docker/docker)

## Flux

Flux is a powerful GitOps toolkit for Kubernetes that enables continuous delivery. It is our tool of choice for CD in Kubernetes and I hope to contribute more soon.

## Firestoned

This is an open source Python project, with a reverse proxy and a way of generating code in a resource first format.

## Why Open Source

Even though I have just scratched the smallest surface in contributing to open source - I want to keep trying as its a fantastic way to learn,
and contribute to awesome projects we use every day.
