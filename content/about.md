## Current Focus

Currently working at RBC on their Kubernetes Platform, focusing on:

- Kubernetes platform engineering
- Programming and containerization
- Working with FluxCD

## Background

Before my interest in programming and development, I was self-employed as a woodworker and furniture maker. Although that is a very different medium than developing software, the creativity and problem-solving nature has always appealed to me.

Working with people and collaborating is also something I value, and I enjoy working in an environment that supports that.

## Education & Certifications

- **NSCC IT Programming Diploma** - Honours - Presidents List
- **AWS Practitioner Certificate** - Complete
